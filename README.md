# My First Portfolio

This repository documents the step-by-step creation of my first personal portfolio website. Starting from the most basic HTML structure, we'll build it up to include styling, interactivity, and more.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Create a valid, simple HTML page as the foundation for a portfolio site.
- **Current Focus**: Basic HTML structure in the `html_basic` directory.
- **Tools Used**: HTML5, GitHub for version control.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
3. Open files in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
4. Make changes, commit, and push:  
5. To test HTML files locally, open them in a web browser.
6. Validate HTML using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Directory Structure
- `html_basic/`: Contains the initial basic HTML file.

## Next Steps
- Fix and validate the basic HTML structure.
- Expand with more HTML elements (to be added in future tasks).
