    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my first web portfolio! I'm learning web development, and this page marks the beginning of my journey to create amazing websites.</p>
    
    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This portfolio is built from scratch, starting with a simple HTML structure. My goal is to showcase my skills as I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>I'm currently exploring the basics of HTML, including how to structure content with headings, paragraphs, and images. Each task builds on the last, helping me create a fully functional portfolio.</p>
    <p>Check out the clickable image below to visit a resource that's helping me learn! Stay tuned for more updates as I add styles and interactivity.</p>
